This text is shown at the top of the README, right below the header section and before the table of contents. Whenever possible, key products/terms should be linked to using markdown. You can see an example of us hyperlinking in this variable by checking out the [Android Studio role]({{ repository.group.ansible_roles }}/androidstudio). The idea is to make it as easy as possible for our users to figure out exactly what the role does."
